Born in Quito, Ecuador and raised in Queens, New York,\n                    Christian discovered his passion for fine artistic craftsmanship during his undergraduate study in the City\n                    University of New York. After returning for an MFA in Sculpture and Interdisciplinary Arts,\n                    Christian was introduced to construction work by a friend, and was contracted for commerical renovation in the\n                    heart of Manhattan.\n            </p>\n                <br />\n                <p>After several of these contracts, it became clear to Christian that the work being done did not match the sky high\n                prices that were being charged. As it turned out, the same kinds of prices were being charged for residential\n                construction as well.\n            </p>\n                <br />\n                <p>With that discovery, Christin sought to bring back honesty, fairness and artisan craftsmanship to construction by\n                starting his own construction group, Essential Works LLC. Now that Essential Works has completed several whole-building\n                renovations, Christian is confident that he too can help you with your renovations and put the artistry in your home--without\n                the Manhattan prices of course.\n\n            </p>\n\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n    </div>\n)\n\nexport default AboutPage;","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/Profile-tiny-c5b7c8e6dccf728c3e50eff9dd3a8f5a.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
